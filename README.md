# Nearest Neighbour Algorithm

This project is my first step into the world of deep learning.  
It implements a simple **Nearest Neighbour algorithm** in C++.  
You can read more about the algorithm here: [Nearest Neighbour Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbour_algorithm).

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- The program is based on the **CIFAR-10** dataset.  
- It reads raw binary data directly from the dataset files.  
- More information about the dataset structure can be found here: [CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

## âš¡ Usage
1. Download the CIFAR-10 dataset (binary version).  
2. Create a folder named `data_batch_1` in your project directory.  
3. Place the raw CIFAR-10 batch files inside this folder.  
4. Compile and run the code (example using g++):
   ```bash
   
   g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o nearest_neighbour
   ./nearest_neighbour
